# Magento-2-Mobile-Login-Extension

In this growing usage of technology, everyone around the world has shifted to smartphones and mobile phones to connect with their close ones. When it comes to shopping online then all the users prefer to utilize mobile numbers whether it is shopping, login, payments, or whatsoever. Basically, during online shopping, all the registration process has many details to add, and due to this many times, customers get frustrated and leave. Because of email login, there are multiple email ids with customers and when they forget which id is used then after some tries of login they will leave. Instead of that mobile login provides a safe and secured login functionality using the OTP. For that MageComp has launched a Mobile Login extension for Magento 2 stores.
